Our [Team Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f1U1kpcvNE-tf4cDfWqKXqCFyr5-8HhCTtcAMeXk4z4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ondungnqregq)

## Overview
Many University of HawaiÊ»i students have incredible musical talent but lack a simple way to connect with others who share compatible musical skills and interests. This gap means they miss out on the joy of informal jam sessions that could grow into dynamic performing groups.

### The Solution
**Jam Sesh-ion** offers a creative platform where students can easily connect and collaborate musically. Users can log in or create profiles showcasing their musical tastes, skills, and goalsâ€”whether theyâ€™re into occasional jam sessions or looking to form a serious band. Each profile can include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks, allowing students to share examples of their musicianship and find others who align with their style and vision.

## User Guide
Upon viewing the application, the user is greeted with the landing page, which prompts them to log in to or create an account.

The user can create an account on the signup page.

After logging in, the user is greeted with the home page.

Here, the user can view the currently posted Jam Sessions:

## Community Feedback
After having five other students try out our application, they had a few suggestions on how to improve our app, and noted a few things that they liked.

* Users liked the presentation of the application, stating that it looks pretty and they like the nature-y asthethic, although they are unsure about how nature connects to a music app.
* They liked how easy it was to add and manage sessions.
* They liked the search function in the view sessions page.
* They didn't like that there wasn't a feature to show the current capacity of a session. They had no way of knowing if a session was filled up or not.
* Some users liked the profile aspect, but others didn't really know why they were needed.

## Developer Guide

To build the application, npm is required, which comes with Node.js. Go to the Node.js official website to install it.

In addition, postgreSQL is also required to store app information in a database. Visit the PostgreSQL page to install it as well.

Download or clone the repository to your computer, and run npm install in the root directory.

Set up a database for the app by running createdb jam-session in the command prompt.

Copy the sample.env file to a new file called .env, and edit the file, setting the DATABASE_URL to 

```
postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/jam-session?schema=public
```
replacing username and password with your postgreSQL credentials.

Migrate the database by running npx prisma migrate dev, and seed it with npx prisma db seed.

Finally, run the app with npm run dev, checking localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

### Milestone 2

[Our M2 Project Page](https://github.com/orgs/Jam-Session-314/projects/7/)

- A page that allows the user to create sessions
- A session management page that allows the user to manage their own sessions
- Users can upload profile pictures to their profile
- A landing page that shows a featured session
