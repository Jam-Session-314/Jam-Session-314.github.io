## Overview
Many University of Hawaiʻi students possess musical talents, yet they lack an easy way to connect with others who share similar tastes and compatible musical skills. This limitation prevents them from experiencing the enjoyment of informal jam sessions, which could potentially evolve into performing musical groups.

**The solution**: Our Jam Shesh-ion application addresses this issue by allowing students to log in or create profiles that showcase their musical tastes, skills, and goals—whether they're interested in occasional jam sessions or forming a performing band. Profiles can also feature links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks, enabling students to share examples of their musicianship and connect with others who resonate with their style and ambitions.
