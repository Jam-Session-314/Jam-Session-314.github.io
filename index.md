Our [Team Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f1U1kpcvNE-tf4cDfWqKXqCFyr5-8HhCTtcAMeXk4z4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ondungnqregq)

## Overview
Many University of HawaiÊ»i students have incredible musical talent but lack a simple way to connect with others who share compatible musical skills and interests. This gap means they miss out on the joy of informal jam sessions that could grow into dynamic performing groups.

### The Solution
**Jam Sesh-ion** offers a creative platform where students can easily connect and collaborate musically. Users can log in or create profiles showcasing their musical tastes, skills, and goalsâ€”whether theyâ€™re into occasional jam sessions or looking to form a serious band. Each profile can include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks, allowing students to share examples of their musicianship and find others who align with their style and vision.
